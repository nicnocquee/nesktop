# Welcome to the Next.js demo app published as NPM package!

I needed a GUI app for my personal project that needed to access the file system. Ideally, I should make a desktop app using native platform or Electron for cross platform support. But developing a native app for macOS, Windows, and Linux would've taken time. Same with Electron even though it's web based.

So I had an idea. Since I am so used to making web apps using Next.js, why don't I make a Next.js app that anyone can run locally easily without cloning and installing dependencies? So basically like Electron app but without the hassle of [managing window lifecycle](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-first-app#managing-your-apps-window-lifecycle) or [learning the process model](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/process-model), etc.

**It turned out it's possible**. Using the template of this website, you can create the Next.js app normally then build it for production. The production build then will be published as NPM package. Then anyone can simply run

```
npx your-next-app-name
```

# Writing and reading files

Writing and reading files from the file system is as easy as using the `fs` module as usual in the server part of Next.js like in the `route.ts` or in [server action](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations).

For example, go to the [add user page](/add-user) and enter an email and password. Then click the "Add user" button. You will see the user added to the `public/data/users.json` file.
