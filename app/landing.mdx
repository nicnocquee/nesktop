# Welcome to Nesktop Demo

## Background

I needed a GUI app for my personal project that required access to the file system. Ideally, I should create a desktop app using a native platform or Electron for cross-platform support. However, developing a native app for macOS, Windows, and Linux would have taken time. The same applies to Electron, even though it's web-based.

So I had an idea. Since I am so used to making web apps using Next.js, why don't I make a Next.js app that anyone can run locally without cloning and installing dependencies? It's basically like an Electron app but without the hassle of [managing window lifecycle](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-first-app#managing-your-apps-window-lifecycle) or [learning the process model](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/process-model), etc.

## Introducing Nesktop

**It turned out it's possible**. Using the [template of this website](https://github.com/nicnocquee/nesktop), you can create the Next.js app normally and then build it for production. The production build will then be published as an NPM package. Then anyone can simply run

```
npx your-next-app-name
```

Once the package is downloaded, it will automatically run the production build of the Next.js app and open the [http://localhost:4323](http://localhost:4323) URL in your browser.

## Usage

### Writing and reading files

Writing and reading files from the file system is as easy as using the `fs` module as usual in the server part of Next.js, like in the `route.ts` or in a [server action](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations).

For example, go to the [add user page](/add-user) and enter an email and password. Then click the "Add user" button. You will see the user added to the `public/data/users.json` file.

### Update Notification

Unlike the Electron app or a Next.js app in the cloud, this app cannot be automatically updated. But the Next.js app in this template gets the current installed version from the package.json file and the latest version from the NPM registry. These values can be accessed from the `process.env.APP_CURRENT_VERSION` and `process.env.APP_LATEST_VERSION` environment variables. If the current version is not the same as the latest version, you can show a notification to the user to update the app like how this app does as you can see in the [UpdateInfo component](https://github.com/nicnocquee/nesktop/blob/main/app/update-info.tsx).

### Special Environment Variables

When the app is run, it injects the following [environment variables which you can use in your Next.js app](https://www.nico.fyi/blog/stop-using-environment-variable-directly):

| Name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ORIGINAL_CWD        | The directory where your package is run from. For example, if you run `npx nesktop` from the `/Users/nico/Downloads` directory, the value of this variable will be `/Users/nico/Downloads`. You should not use `process.cwd()` because it will return the directory where NPM installed your package. |
| APP_NAME            | The name of the app as defined in `package.json`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| APP_CURRENT_VERSION | The current version of the app as defined in `package.json`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| APP_LATEST_VERSION  | The latest version of the app which is published to NPM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
